When you call join() on a thread, the main thread will wait until the thread has finished before continuing execution. This is useful if you need to ensure that a certain thread has completed before continuing with the rest of your code.\n",

    "Deadlocks and race conditions are common concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource. This can happen when one thread holds a resource that another thread needs, and that second thread holds a resource that the first thread needs. This situation creates a circular dependency, where each thread is waiting for the other to release the resource, and neither can make progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a program with two threads: Thread A and Thread B. Thread A holds Resource 1 and is waiting for Resource 2, while Thread B holds Resource 2 and is waiting for Resource 1. Since neither thread can proceed until it acquires the other resource, the program is deadlocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition, on the other hand, occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource in an unpredictable order, leading to unexpected or incorrect results. This can happen when multiple threads attempt to modify the same variable or object, and the order of those modifications is not deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a program with two threads: Thread A and Thread B. Both threads access a shared variable called \"counter\" and increment it by 1. However, the order in which these increments occur is not guaranteed, and the final value of \"counter\" may be unpredictable. This is a race condition, as the final result depends on the order in which the threads execute, which may vary depending on factors such as thread scheduling and timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions can be difficult to detect and diagnose, as they can depend on a variety of external factors and may not be easily reproducible. To avoid these issues, it is important to design multithreaded programs carefully, with appropriate synchronization and coordination between threads to avoid conflicts and ensure correct behavior."
